      Three Important Lessons from Atomic Habits
The essential ideas from three of the book's main concepts are presented in the following section of the Atomic Habits synopsis. 
<li>Lesson 1: Small habits make a big difference
It is very simple to overestimate a single moment that changed everything and to undervalue the value of daily incremental advances. 
While a 1 percent improvement may not seem like much—and in some cases, it isn't even noticeable—it might mean much more in the long term. 
It's amazing how much of an impact even a small improvement can have over time. The maths says that if you can improve by 1 percent every day for a year, you will be 37 times better when it is all said and done. On the other hand, if you get 1% worse every day for a year, you'll almost reach zero. What begins as a small victory or a small loss grows into something much bigger.
It doesn't matter if you're now successful or unsuccessful. It's important to consider whether your habits are leading you in the direction of success. Concentrate on improving 1% more each day. </li>
<li> Lesson 2: Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. 
Your desired outcomes are what matter when setting goals. Systems are concerned with the procedures that produce those outcomes.
It's not you who needs to change your habits if you're having problems doing so. Your system is the issue. Bad habits keep coming back, not because you don't want to change but rather because your strategy for change is flawed. </li>
<li>Lesson 3: Build identity-based habits
Focusing on developing a new identity initially is the secret to developing long-lasting habits. Simply said, your current identity is reflected in your current behaviours. What you are doing right now is a reflection of the kind of person you think you are, whether consciously or unconsciously.
You must begin to believe new things about yourself if you want to permanently alter your behaviour. Create identity-based practises for yourself. </li>
